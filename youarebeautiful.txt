## To all my good friends 

First, you are absolutely beautiful. Your asymmetry, your experiences, pictures that only your eyes have seen: they all compose the poetry that makes you so unique and so magnificent.

Second, you are absolutely perfect. You are the most amazing composition, so perfectly perfect that you cannot be reproduced. You are never finished, an unfinished perfect beauty. Please, do not forget that.

Third, your life is yours. It's your given game, every second is yours. Take control of your world, you have this right. There is an agenda by many powerful entities to keep you insecure, unhappy, and slaved. There is an agenda in this particular society to keeps us unfocused from our own rights and from pursuing true happiness and satisfaction. Enfold your identity and fill your heart with power, compassion and love: I guarantee you that this will be enough.

Fourth, you are going to die. Stop avoiding this fact: you are going to die, it is going to happen. And before that, you are going to spend some time realizing that the best moments you had were those when you jumped. The greatest times were those when you faced your fear and you loved yourself, and consequently others, life, and the chance of being.

Throw away all the oppression that you have faced in your life, put it in some small box in your brain and never open it. You need to keep the innocence, you need to believe in your dreams. Forget age. Another prison, another agenda. Every generation is changing the world, and you too belong to the newer generation, you belong to where your heart is.

How funny is that all these lines are cliches but still might be the best recipe to live fully?

Don't wait too long to realize that. I wish I had perceived this when I was younger. But, hey, no regrets: being humble and embracing learning is what makes us wise and resilient.

I believe in you and I love you and I want YOU to be HAPPY, to follow ALL your crazy DREAMS, and to DANCE like a crazy person.
